# What's a middle tier framework?

A middle tier framework is code that facilitates creating business logic in a reusable, extensible, maintainable, and testable manner.   It promotes creating business logic that is completely decoupled from its consuming technologies and helps to ensure that separation of concerns ([SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)) are adhered to.

##### Peasy.NET offers/addresses the following:

- [Async support](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/The-Asynchronous-Pipeline)
- [Business rules](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Business-Rules)/[validation](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Validation-Rules) engine
- [Concurrency](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/BusinessServiceBase#concurrency-handling)
- [Multiple client support](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Multiple-client-support)
- [Multiple deployment scenario support](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/data-proxy#multiple-deployment-scenarios)
- [Scalability](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/data-proxy#scalability)
- [Testability](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Testing)
- [Thread safety](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Thread-Safety)
- [Transactional support and fault tolerance](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/ITransactionContext)

# The main actors

### Data Proxy
The [data proxy](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Data-Proxy) is responsible for data storage and retrieval, and serves as an abstraction layer for data stores (database, web services, cache, etc.).

### Rule
A rule can be created to represent a [business](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Business-Rules) rule (authorization, price validity, etc.) or a [validation](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Validation-Rules) rule (field length, required, etc.). Rules are consumed by commands and can be chained, configured to execute based on a previous ruleâ€™s execution, etc. Rules can also be configured to invoke code based on the result of their execution.

### Command
The [command](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/Command) is responsible for orchestrating the execution of initialization logic, business and validation rule execution, and other logic (data proxy invocations, workflow logic, etc.), respectively, via the command execution pipeline.

### Business Service
A [business service](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki/ServiceBase) implementation represents an entity (e.g. users, or projects) and is responsible for exposing business functionality via commands. These commands encapsulate CRUD and other business related logic.

# Where can I get it?

### Visual Studio

Install Peasy from the package manager console:

``` PM> Install-Package Peasy ```

### VS Code

Install Peasy from the command line:

``` dotnet add package peasy ```


# Getting started

You can get started by reviewing the [getting started example](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki#the-simplest-possible-example) on the Peasy wiki.  The wiki also covers in-depth how-to's, general framework design, and usage scenarios.

You can also check out the [samples repo](https://github.com/peasy/Samples) that contains a sample implementation of a middle tier built with peasy, as well as sample consumer clients (WPF, Web API, ASP.NET MVC).  You can clone the repo or download the entire project as a [zip](https://github.com/peasy/samples/archive/master.zip).  

Once downloaded, open Orders.com.sln with Visual Studio, set the WPF or ASP.NET MVC project as the startup project and run.  More information about the samples application can be found [here](https://github.com/peasy/Samples).
